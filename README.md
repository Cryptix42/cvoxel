Just expirementing with raylib and generating meshes.
I figured a good place to start would be to learn how voxels are made and rendered. 
Eventually I want to learn procedural generation. 
I have used chatGPT for suggestions and one large code snippet but its only a starting point.
This is a self-education project to learn and get proficient in C.
